# FAERS Data Mining #

The objective is to identify adverse drug events (ADEs) in the CMS claims data 
with the aid of information from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. This effort will evaluate the 
utility of CMS claims data for identifying potential adverse drug events and 
if successful will improve the timeliness of ADE detection. Some of the studies 
such as detecting association between Statin Use and Cancer (Mai Fujimoto, 2015), 
Retrospective Detection of Drug Safety Signals and Adverse Events in Electronic 
General Practice Records (Andrew Tomlin, 2012), Drug safety surveillance using 
de-identified EMR and claims data (PM, 2010) and Leveraging Food and Drug 
Administration Adverse Event Reports for the Automated Monitoring of Electronic 
Health Records in a Pediatric Hospital (Tang H, 2017) present several approaches 
that can be used.
