# Step by step approach to arrive at the cms file with patients prescribed with diabetes drugs:
The same approach can be used to extract patients prescribed with drugs for hypertension, depression etc.
The NDC code list was obtained from data.gov website
Total Diabetis NDC code list from data.gov: 4335

In the final CMS master file (the file resulting from executing commands in cms_cmds.txt),

Total CMS records extracted: 85873407
Total patients from the CMS file having atleast drug code from the NDC diabetis code list: 325889
Total CMS records for patient prsecribed with diabetis drugs (from data.gov NDC list): 68009030
Percentage of inpatients prescribed with diabetes drugs: 79.2%

Step by step approach to arrive at the final cms file

# Step 1: Copy and paste the list of NDC into a text file ndccodes.txt. Convert the txt file into an csv file by
eliminatig carriage return.

	sed 's/ \+/,/g' ndccodes.txt > ndctmp01.csv

# Step 2: Delete the manually created txt file.

	sort -u ndctmp01.csv > ndcdisease.csv

# Step 3: Delete the temporary work file.

	rm ndctmp01.csv

# Step 4: Extract the columns beneficiary id/DESYNPUF_ID and NDC codes/PROD_SRVC_ID from the CMS master file.

	awk -F, '{print $1,$5}' OFS=, cms.csv > cmsndclist.csv

# Step 5: Join the input NDC codes with CMS file NDCs to get the corresponding beneficiary ID's

	join -t, -1 1 -2 2 <(sort -t, -k1 ndcdisease.csv) <(sort -t, -k2 cmsndclist.csv) > ndccmstmp01.csv

# Step 6: extract the list of beneficiaries for the input list of ndc codes.

	awk -F, '{print $2}' OFS=, ndccmstmp01.csv > patienttemp01.csv

# Step 7: eliminate the duplicates and sort the file

	sort -u patienttemp01.csv > patient.csv

# Step 8: Extract all CMS information for beneficiaries with diabetes drugs NDCs

	join -t, <(sort -t, -k1 cms.csv) <(sort -t, -k1 patient.csv) > cmspatndc.csv

# Step 9: Delete the temporary work files.

	rm ndccmstmp01.csv
	rm patienttemp01.csv
	rm patient.csv

# Step 10: Copy the cms master header into separate file.

	head -1 cms.csv > cms_header.csv

# Step 11: Merge the cms header record with the diabetes cms file information.

	cat cms_header.csv cmspatndc.csv > cms_diabetic.csv

# The above commands in one step
